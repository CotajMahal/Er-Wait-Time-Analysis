# Er-Wait-Time-Analysis
Capstone Project to analyse ED wait times correlating to satisfaction using Python and Tableau
# Emergency Department Wait Time Analysis

## Overview
This project explores patterns in emergency department (ED) wait times and patient satisfaction across multiple hospitals. I used Python in Google Colab to clean and analyze the data, and built interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the results.

The goal was to identify which factors â€” like region, urgency level, or hospital staffing â€” influence how long patients wait, and how that impacts their experience.

## Tools
- Google Colab (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau Public
- GitHub

## Key Takeaways
- Some hospitals had consistently longer wait times, but that didnâ€™t always mean lower satisfaction.
- Urban hospitals had more variability in wait times, but average delays were similar to rural ones.
- Satisfaction was loosely tied to wait time, but other factors (likely communication or care quality) played a role.

## Dashboards
ðŸ“Š [Interactive Tableau Dashboard]

Includes filters by region, urgency level, and time of day.


## Notes
The dataset is simulated but designed to reflect realistic ED operations and patient flow. This capstone was created as part of my data analysis learning path and includes both coding and BI components.
